        <i> DR5Y Tech </i> was created by our technical specialist, Lefika Andrew Setuke. After finishing his module on <b> Web and Multimedia Design </b> he went on to test his knowledge and skills and started desinging his own website, DR5Y Tech.
        Our space focuses on bringing in young computer specialists and many other people that are passionate and would love to get into creating and designing their own website in future. We offer weekly training followed by practical tests and exams that test your knowledge and skills from all that you would have learned from the trainings that you would have been provided with.
